# Unfinished project - currently in development

This is unfinished project currently being developed (in my spare time) mainly for my own learning purposes. 
Feel free to give any constructive critique, it would be more than welcome.

The plan is to develop RSS feed reader/aggregator REST API which could be used by some client (or standalone if one wishes so), 
be it some JavaScript frontend client, WPF application, etc.
